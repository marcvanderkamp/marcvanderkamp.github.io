#About this Website

I am currently building this website. Its setup is based on [chryswoods.com](http://chryswoods.com), who kindly has provided [instructions](http://chryswoods.com/main/website.html) and openly hosts his website on github, as do I. Thanks, Christopher!  
I intend to use the following components:

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - This provides the base CSS, fonts and 
javascript for the site.

In addition, the website is built using:

* [GitHub](http://github.com) - The entire website is version controlled and hosted
in [this repository](https://github.com/marcvanderkamp/marcvanderkamp.io). Each webpage is
written in GitHub-flavoured markdown, in which there is a little embedded HTML. 
* [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) - I intend use Pandoc to convert the GitHub flavoured markdown into 
HTML5. 
* [Python](http://python.org) - I will be using a small [Python script](https://github.com/chryswoods/siremol.org/blob/master/chryswoods.com/pandoc/convert_to_html.py), written by chryswoods,
which uses Pandoc to convert all of the markdown files in the directories for the website
into HTML5. 

You can create your own copy of this website by installing Python, Pandoc and git, and then
cloning the site using the command;

    git clone https://github.com/marcvanderkamp/marcvanderkamp.github.io
